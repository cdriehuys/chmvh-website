        <p>
          Dr. Sunita Driehuys has been a practicing small animal veterinarian
          since 1994. She received her bachelorâ€™s degree from Franklin &amp;
          Marshall College in Lancaster, PA. She received her veterinary degree
          in 1994 from the University of Pennsylvania with magna cum laude
          honors. She furthered her training with a one year internship that
          emphasized emergency and critical care medicine.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since moving to the Triangle in 1996 she has practiced at several
          high-caliber small animal practices. These experiences led to her
          desire to create a veterinary practice that could combine the highest
          quality veterinary care with personalized attention and relationships.
        </p>

        <p>
          This vision is now being fulfilled through Chapel Hill Mobile
          Veterinary Housecalls. A core practice philosophy is that the
          continuous pursuit of knowledge and education is the best way to care
          for her clients and patients. Dr. Driehuys has been certified as a
          Diplomate by the American Board of Veterinary Practitioners (ABVP)
          specializing in canine and feline practice. She lives in Chapel Hill,
          NC, with her husband and 3 sons.
